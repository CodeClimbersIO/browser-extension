## Overall guidelines | Suggestions

- üôè Thank you for your help! Your contributions will motivate developers to do greater things!
- ü•á Keep it simple. We don't need optimizations right now. We need features!
- ü§ñ Built by devs for devs so if you want to make a change to make things better, do it! Make a PR and let rphovley know
  to review it. If it's a big change, a heads up before you start will save some heartache.

## Quick Start

- Have Chrome & Firefox installed
- npm install
- npm run dev

### Conventions

- All files should be typescript and avoid `any` types within reason
- Components should be functional and the name should be PascalCase
- All components should reside in the `components` directory.
- Styling: make use of the `sx` attribute for any material-ui customizations.
- Styling: make use of the appropriate material-ui components for layouts like `Grid` or `Stack` when possible, but `Box` is a great fallback
- Styling: when needing to do your own work with `Box` for layouts, make use of `flex` instead of other css layout types where possible
